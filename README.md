[![End-to-end tests](https://github.com/chibytez/quandooweb/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chibytez/quandooweb/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml)

## Selected Technology Stack:
  - The test suite was designed using Cypress

## Reason Behind Using Framework:
- Used cypress because it makes web automation so seamless, it uses less dependency like selenium

- Also made use of the page object model to make sure that my code is maintainable and readable. Also made sure I made use of functions in a case where codes are reused mutiple times.

- I also implemented CI/CD with the use github action to make sure I can confidently deploy and merge to the main branch if I'm using multiple branches.

## How to Run 
- Clone/download Repo
- From the cloned repo, run "npm install" on the terminal of the folder containing the repo
- To open on web browser run "npm run open", to run on the terminal or headless run "npm run start"

## Improvements:
- the error message should be specific and spontanous
